                Unsorted        Sorted          Reversed        Partial
Insertion       0.672468        0.000640        1.338961        0.502118

Question 1:
Insertion Sort performed the best on pre-sorted lists.
Insertion Sort performed the worst on reversed lists.

Question 2:
Insertion Sort's best and worst input differ by a factor of 4.
This is because it does't enter the while loop at all for a pre-sorted list,
    but has to execute the while loop at (index + 1) times.

Question 3:
Bubble Sort performed the best on reversed lists.
Bubble Sort performed the worst on unsorted list.

Question 4:
Bubble Sort's best and worst input differ by a factor of 0.
This is because it's best and worse case run times are both O(n^2).

Question 5:
Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort are both slower than Python's built in function
    in every case by at least a factor of 4.
